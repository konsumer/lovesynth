# lovesynth

*NOTE*: I got annoyed with how lua/love handles sub-processes, and switched to making [this project](https://github.com/konsumer/fluiray)

This is a love-based frontend for fluidsynth. It's meant to turn a small computer with a joystick & small screen (pi, RG351P, etc) into a midi synth.

You will need a MIDI keyboard, a USB host adapter, and some soundfonts.

Edit conf.lua to configure.
